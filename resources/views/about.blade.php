        <h2>Why EMFI?</h2>
        <p>EMFI came into being in response to a market that is highly fragmented, with divergent needs of onshore and offshore investors going unaddressed.</p>
        <p>Traditional market makers are heavily focused on certain segments as well as products and services that fit into their top down business structures, at the expense of others.</p>
        <p>EMFI aims to bridge those gaps by taking a bottom up approach to identify fragments and provide customized and tailored solutions to address those needs.</p>

        <h2>ONSHORE INVESTORS</h2>
        <p>We deliver up-to-date market colour from major financial centers of the world to local investors who might operate in a very different context.</p>
        <p>We provide our expertise and analysis to less sophisticated onshore clients who might be ignored by traditional players due to their size.</p>
        <p>Through our business partners, we provide direct market access to a 100 markets in 25 developed and emerging countries.</p>

        <h2>OFFSHORE INVESTORS</h2>
        <p>We actively service high beta Latin American sovereign and quasi-sovereign markets where traditional coverage is lacking at best.</p>
        <p>We are able to deliver superior local intelligence in a timely manner due to the depth and breadth of our onshore relationships.</p>
        <p>We are better positioned to match local flows with external investors, as well as EM dedicated flows with crossover and high yield clients.</p>
